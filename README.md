This paper conducts a human motion analysis using Euler angle data captured from a commercial body sensor network composed of Inertial-Magnetic Measurement Unit (IMMU) array called Xens Awinda Mtw. The latter falls in the relatively new and popular category of the state-of-the-art micro-electromechanical system sensors-based motion capture systems that unlike their visual based counterparts are free from the constraints of sensitivity to the environment and its size and are cost-effective. The Xsens MTw Awinda body sensor network is used to collect motion data of the body key joints, and the data are delivered to the workstation wirelessly. Then, the proposed system uses analytical forward and inverse kinematics algorithms to analyze the Euler angle data while dealing with the issues of singularities and gimbal lock. Human body motion analysis system mainly involves the challenging tasks of designing the 3D human skeleton model and the development of a system that processes the sensor data referenced to a common base reference to be mapped with reference to other sensors based on a defined parent-child hierarchy relationship between the sensor nodes. As a result, the human body is abstracted into 16 key joints affecting human movement for the model. The prior is then transformed into a parent-child hierarchy with hip sensor node as the parent. The experimental results confirmed with 3 joints of the right arm that the model and the system are able to closely visualize the motion captured by the IMMU body sensor network. The proposed software solution works collaboratively with the hardware of motion capture system to provide good consistency of 3D skeleton stance and effective motion, and the implementation can be expanded to all 16-joints in the future for low-cost and simple analytical applications.
